<p class="subtitle">Cemetery Project Update:</p>

<p>

Alhamdulillah, ICBN has signed the cemetery contract with Evergreen Memorial Cemetery .
ICBN has pre-sold 15 of the 20 plots it purchased.  The remaining 5 will be used as necessary.
These plots are positioned properly, so when the plane of the body is turned on its right side it faces the Kabba
(northeast).  Also, special instructions have been given to and recorded in writing by they cemetery so the
Islamic practice and etiquette are followed at the time of burial.
<br><br>


We would like to thank all the individuals that worked on the first phase of this project and a special
thanks to Br. Mufti Haroon (<a href="http://www.islamicfuneralservices.net/">Muslim Funeral Services</a> Director) for guiding us in the process, ensuring all the Islamic requirements were met.
<br><br>

<b>If you have any questions, please contact ICBN (<a href="mailto:icbn-cemetery@usicbn.org?Subject='Question Regarding Cemetery'">icbn-cemetery@usicbn.org</a>) .
